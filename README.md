## Description
This is a C# console application that utilizes classes and interfaces to describe a zoo. This application uses the four pillars of Object Oriented Programming, which are Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism and Encapsulation.
This application also makes use of interfaces, which contain method signatures of what is required for that action to be completed. In our case, our interfaces are IFly and ISwim.
